**Health Insurance Cost Predictor**

**Overview**

The Health Insurance Cost Predictor is a machine learning-based project designed to estimate individual health insurance costs based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and geographical location. The project aims to provide data-driven insights for individuals and insurance providers to understand premium pricing better.

**Dataset**

Source: Kaggle (Medical Insurance Dataset)

**Features:** Age, BMI, Smoking Status, Number of Children, Region

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling Techniques: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression

Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, RÂ² Score

**Key Findings**

Smoking significantly increases insurance costs.

Age and BMI have a strong correlation with premium prices.

Gradient Boosting Regression outperformed Linear Regression in prediction accuracy.

**Future Enhancements**

Incorporating additional features like medical history and lifestyle habits.

Deploying the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
